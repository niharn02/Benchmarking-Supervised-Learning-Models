# Benchmarking-Supervised-Learning-Models
This project benchmarks the performance of six popular supervised learning algorithms on two datasets: the Heart Disease Dataset and the Loan Approval Dataset. The goal is to evaluate and compare the accuracy, precision, recall, and other performance metrics of these models to identify the most effective algorithm for each dataset.

Supervised Learning Algorithms:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
AdaBoost
Datasets:
Heart Disease Dataset: Used to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on clinical features.
Loan Approval Dataset: Used to predict loan approval decisions based on applicant data.
Key Features:
Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Comparative analysis of model performance on different datasets.
Code and results are well-documented for ease of understanding and reproducibility.
